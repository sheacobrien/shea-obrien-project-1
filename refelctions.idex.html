    <h1>Reflections:</h1>

    <h2>My internet use </h2>
    <p2>  
        I primarily use the internet to get inspiration for clothes, design, food, interior design, art, etc. I love the app Pinterest because it allows me to organize my inspiration into different categories and also allows me to revisit all the phases I've been through. I love Instagram as well because my Instagram page is kind of like my mood board and lets me express myself through pictures. I also love to use it as a space to display all the photos that I take. I've curated my Instagram to fit my essence perfectly which I love. Aside from using the internet for personal use, I also use the internet quite a bit for school. I use it to search for things, help me with homework, and complete assignments. 
    </p2>

    <h3>My hopes for the internet in the future</h3>
    <p3>My biggest hope for the internet right now and in the future is a drama-free and transparent space. I feel like there are so many social media platforms that are centered around drama, which is why I've narrowed my social media apps to Instagram and Pinterest. Aside from social media apps and focusing more on the actual internet where we search for things, I think it would be cool for people to start and continue to make their own internet space. In the article, The Handmade Web and Website is a Shifting House Next to a River of Knowledge, What Would Yours Be?, the author states that “Having a website can not only be a space to display your work but also help create and form your identity. A website can be a room, a shelf, a planet, etc and I like these descriptions because it makes the internet feel less intimidating.” I love this take on what a website can be. It's cool to view the internet more as your own curated space rather than view it as something daunting.

    I remember in this moment face timing one of my friends which is one of my main reasons for using the internet. I am from out of state and I use my computer and phone quiet a bit to keep in touch with my family and friends from home.

    As I mentioned previously, I use the internet a lot for school and studying. I frequently go to cafes and do homework because I like being out of my own space and I like the cafe environment.

    I remember this was the first picture taken with GlanceBack and it was actually in design class. Being a design minor most of my work is done digitally using the internet! I clearly was taken very off guard in this picture!

<h5>I am hopeful about the internet moving forward</h5>

<h6>Touching Some Grass</h6>
<p6>
    My life online actually feels pretty authentic. I love to take pictures of pretty things around me that I see every day because it reminds me that there is beauty in the little things. On my Instagram, I have a lot of pictures from my travels, of my friends, and again of the things I see on a day-to-day basis. I think for a lot of people, especially on apps like Instagram, it's easy to get caught up in feeling like we need to have the most perfectly curated Instagram so our lives look interesting, but I like that my own personal social media platforms reflect my life accurately. I do like to post my best pictures but I wouldn't say I'm going out of the way to make them look better.

 In this assignment titled “Touching Some Grass”, we were asked to go on a walk and take 20 pictures of what we see around us. I went to the beach, to China town to get food, and walked around Crissy Fields. Click the link in white to view my images with a special effect!
